	Example of how to use!
		
	HitPart TARGETS head: "Head";
	HitPart IGNORES head: --"Head";

	The "--" before the text is there so it can be ignored!

	You can also straight up delete the entire hitpart from the script and it works fine

	Some of these options contain basic; "true or false" statements

	Spell your "true" and "false" options correctly in all lowercase or it will error!

	You may delete all the comments (grey text in your executor)
